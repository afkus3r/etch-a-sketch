<h1 align="center">Etch-a-Sketch</h1>

This sketch tool lets you doodle simple designs by hovering your mouth over the grid. I made this website as part of the second JavaScript assignment of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to discover DOM manipulation.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to create a simple sketch tool to show basic DOM manipulation skills. These are some of the conditions given by The Odin Project (see the complete assignment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)):
- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
  - Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try making them by hand with copy and pasting in your HTML file!
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

### Optional

- Instead of just changing the color of a square from black to white (for example), have each pass through with the mouse change it to a completely random RGB value. 

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
  - I used Flexbox to arrange the squares inside the grid
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
